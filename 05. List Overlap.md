# 5. List Overlap

Randomly generate two lists.    
And write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).   
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.   

# Answer

```python
import random

# Generate random two lists
list_1 = random.choices(range(1, 11), k=random.randint(5,15))
list_2 = random.choices(range(1, 11), k=random.randint(5,15))

print(list_1)
print(list_2)

# Generate a list contain common elements between two lists
list_answer = []

for a in list_1:
    for b in list_2:
        if a == b:
            list_answer.append(a)
            
print(list(set(list_answer)))
```
