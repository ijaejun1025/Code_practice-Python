# 8. Rock Paper Scissors

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.   
Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner.    
And ask if the players want to start a new game.   

# Answer

```python
import random

print("Welcome to the Rock-Papaer-Scissors game!")

while True:
    user = input("Choose between Rock, Paper or Scissors.")
    computer = random.choice(["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])
    
    if user == "Rock":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("Draw!")
        elif computer == "Scissors":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You win!")
        elif computer == "Paper":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You lose!")
    elif user == "Paper":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You win!")
        elif computer == "Scissors":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You lose!")
        elif computer == "Paper":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("Draw")
    elif user == "Scissors":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You lose!")
        elif computer == "Scissors":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("Draw!")
        elif computer == "Paper":
            print("computer choose " + computer)
            print("You win")
    else:
        print("You entered the wrong answer.")
        
    restart = input("Do you want to play again? (Yes/No)")
    if restart == "Yes":
        continue
    else:
        break
```
