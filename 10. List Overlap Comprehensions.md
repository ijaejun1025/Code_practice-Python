# 10. List Overlap Comprehensions

Take two lists, say for example these two:   
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]    
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]    

 and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).   
 Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.   

# Answer

```python
import random

size = random.randrange(5,16)
list_1 = random.choices(range(1,11), k=size)
size = random.randrange(5,16)
list_2 = random.choices(range(1,11), k=size)
answer_list = []

for number_1 in list_1:
    for number_2 in list_2:
        if number_1 == number_2:
            answer_list.append(number_1)
            
print(list_1)
print(list_2)
print(set(answer_list))
```
