# 11. Check Primality Functions

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.   
For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.   

# Answer

```python
my_number = input("Enter the number: ")
my_number = int(my_number)
prime_status = True

if my_number == 1:
    prime_status = False
else:
    for num in range(2, my_number):
        if my_number % num == 0:
            prime_status = False
            break
        elif my_number % num != 0:
            prime_status == True

if prime_status == True:
    print(my_number, "is the prime number.")
else:
    print(my_number, "is not the prime number.")
```
