# 13. Fibonacci

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.   
Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.   
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.   

# Answer

```python
Fibonacci_number = int(input("How many Fibonacci numbers do you want to generate?"))
answer = []

if Fibonacci_number <= 0:
    print("Enter the positive number.")
elif Fibonacci_number == 1:
    answer = [1]
    print(answer)
elif Fibonacci_number >= 2:
    answer = [1, 1]
    for num in range(2, Fibonacci_number):
        new_number = answer[num-2] + answer[num-1]
        answer.append(new_number)
        print(answer)
```
