Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.   
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.   
For example) "My name is Michele"   ->   "Michele is name My"
  
# Answer

user_string = user_string[::-1]
print(" ".join(user_string))
```
