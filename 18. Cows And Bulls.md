# 18. Cows And Bulls

Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user.    

The game works like this:   
Randomly generate a 4-digit number.    
Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number.    
For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”.   
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.”   
Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have.   
Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.   
Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.    

# Answer

```python
import random
print("Welcome to the Cows and Bulls Game!")

# Generate computer number
com_number = random.randint(1000, 9999)
com_number = str(com_number)

# Track the attempts
attempts = 0

# Main game
game_status = True

while game_status:
    # Input user number
    user_number = input("Enter a number (1000 ~ 9999): ")
    
    # Exception handling
    if user_number.isdigit() == True and len(user_number) == 4:
        print("Your number is " + user_number)
    else:
        print("Invalid number")
        exit()

    # add attempts
    attempts += 1
    
    # Convert user_number and com_number to lists
    user_number_list = list(user_number)
    com_number_list = list(com_number)

    # Count cows
    num_cows = 0
    for i in range(len(user_number_list)):
        if user_number_list[i] == com_number_list[i]:
            num_cows += 1
            
    #  Count bulls
    num_bulls = 0
    for j in range(len(user_number_list)):
        for k in range(len(user_number_list)):
            if user_number_list[j] == com_number_list[k]:
                num_bulls += 1
                if j == k:
                    num_bulls -= 1
            
    print(str(num_cows) + " cows, " + str(num_bulls) + " bulls")
    
    # Check the answer
    if num_cows == 4:
        print(f"Congratulation! you gussed the correct number {com_number} in {attempts} attempts")
        game_status = False
```
