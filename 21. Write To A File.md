# 21. Write To A File

Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise.   
Instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt file.   
In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.   

# Answer

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

base_url = 'http://www.nytimes.com'
r = requests.get(base_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, features="lxml")

filename = input("File to save to: ")

with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    for story_heading in soup.find_all(['h2', 'h3', 'h4'], class_=True):
        heading_text = ""
        if story_heading.a:
            heading_text = story_heading.a.text.replace("\n", " ").strip()
        else:
            heading_text = story_heading.get_text().replace("\n", " ").strip()
        
        if heading_text:  # Ensure heading text is not empty
            print(heading_text)
            f.write(heading_text + "\n")
```
