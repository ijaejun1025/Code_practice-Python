# 22. Read From File

Given a .txt file that has a list of a bunch of names.   
Count how many of each name there are in the file, and print out the results to the screen.   

# Answer

```python
# Make a new dictionary
counter_dict = {}

# Open the file
with open('C:/Users/USER/Desktop/name.txt') as f:
	# read the txt file line by line
    line = f.readline()
	
    while line:
		# Removes any leading, and trailing whitespaces. 
        line = line.strip()
		
        # If a duplicate word is found in the list,
        if line in counter_dict:
            counter_dict[line] += 1
        else:
            counter_dict[line] = 1
        line = f.readline()

print(counter_dict)
```
