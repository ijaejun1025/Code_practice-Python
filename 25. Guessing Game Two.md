# 25. Guessing Game Two

You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100.    
The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.    
At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.    

# Answer

```python
import random

def guess_number():
    user_number = int(input("Choose the number between 1 and 100 : "))
    count = 1
    condition = True
    com_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    com_number_small = 0
    com_number_big = 100
    
    while condition:
        if com_number < user_number:
            print(f'Computer choose {com_number}')
            com_number_small = com_number
            print(f'Computer adjust the range between {com_number_small} and {com_number_big}')
            com_number = random.randint(com_number_small, com_number_big)
            count += 1
        elif com_number > user_number:
            print(f'Computer choose {com_number}')
            com_number_big = com_number
            print(f'Computer adjust the range between {com_number_small} and {com_number_big}')
            com_number = random.randint(com_number_small, com_number_big)
            count += 1
        elif com_number == user_number:
            print(f"user number is {user_number} and computer number is {com_number}")
            print(f"Computer tried {count} times")
            condition = False
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```
