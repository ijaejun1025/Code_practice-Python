# 26. Check Tic Tac Toe Solutions

We are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board.   
We will simply focus on checking whether someone has won a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the moves were made.   

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:   
```python
game = [[1, 2, 0],
	[2, 1, 0],
	[2, 1, 1]]
```

0 means an empty square.   
1 means that player 1 put their token in that space.   
2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.   

Your task:   
Given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board.   
Tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any.
