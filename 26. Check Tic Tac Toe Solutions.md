# 26. Check Tic Tac Toe Solutions

We are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board.   
We will simply focus on checking whether someone has won a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the moves were made.   

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:   
```python
game = [[1, 2, 0],
	[2, 1, 0],
	[2, 1, 1]]
```

0 means an empty square.   
1 means that player 1 put their token in that space.   
2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.   

Your task:   
Given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board.   
Tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any.   

# Answer

```python
import numpy as np

# Tic-Tac-Toe game board
game = [
    [2, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 1]
]

# line_match(game)
# Checks if any row in the game board has the same non-zero value (indicating a winning row).
def line_match(game):
    for row in game:
        if len(set(row)) == 1 and row[0] != 0:
            return row[0]
    return 0

def column_match(game):
    # Uses numpy's transpose function to swap rows and columns.
    transposed_game = np.transpose(game)
    for col in transposed_game:
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != 0:
            return col[0]
    return 0

# diagonal_match(game)
# Checks if either of the two diagonals in the game board has the same non-zero value (indicating a winning diagonal).
def diagonal_match(game):
    if game[1][1] != 0:
        if game[1][1] == game[0][0] == game[2][2]:
            return game[1][1]
        elif game[1][1] == game[0][2] == game[2][0]:
            return game[1][1]
    return 0

row_winner = line_match(game)
column_winner = column_match(game)
diagonal_winner = diagonal_match(game)

if row_winner > 0:
    print(f"{row_winner} row wins!")
if column_winner > 0:
    print(f"{column_winner} column wins!")
if diagonal_winner > 0:
    print(f"{diagonal_winner} diagonal wins!")

```
