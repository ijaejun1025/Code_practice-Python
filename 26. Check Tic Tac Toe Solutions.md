# 26. Check Tic Tac Toe Solutions

We are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board.   
We will simply focus on checking whether someone has won a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the moves were made.   

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:   

```python
game = [[1, 2, 0],
	[2, 1, 0],
	[2, 1, 1]]
```
