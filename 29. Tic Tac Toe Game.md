# 29. Tic Tac Toe Game

In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Python.   
The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game.   

# Answer

```python
import random

# Compose the graph
def print_graph(graph):
    print()
    print(graph[0][0], ' | ', graph[0][1], ' | ', graph[0][2])
    print('-------------')
    print(graph[1][0], ' | ', graph[1][1], ' | ', graph[1][2])
    print('-------------')
    print(graph[2][0], ' | ', graph[2][1], ' | ', graph[2][2])

# Check if the spot which you want to put value is blank or not
def is_free_position(graph, column_index, row_index):
    return graph[row_index][column_index] == ' '
 
# Check who win the game
def is_winner(graph, mark):
     if (graph[0][0] == mark and graph[0][1] == mark and graph[0][2] == mark) or\
        (graph[1][0] == mark and graph[1][1] == mark and graph[1][2] == mark) or\
        (graph[2][0] == mark and graph[2][1] == mark and graph[2][2] == mark) or\
