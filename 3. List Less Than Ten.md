# 3. List Less Than Ten

Take a list, say for example this one:   
list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]   
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.   

# Answer
```python
list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
Answer_list = []

for num in list:
    if num < 5:
        Answer_list.append(num)
        
print(Answer_list)
```
