In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.    
Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code.   
This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments.

import random

# word file
file = open("C:/Users/USER/Desktop/sowpods.txt", 'r')
line = file.readlines()
word_list = []
for word in line:
    word_list.append(word)
file.close()

# word choose
choice_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(choice_word)
```
