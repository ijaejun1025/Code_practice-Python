# 31. Guess Letters

In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter.   
The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed.   

Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”.   
For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.   
For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word.   

As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and display a different message if the player tries to guess that letter again.   
Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly.   

# Answer

```python
import random

# introduction
print("Welcome to the Hangman Game!")

# import word file
file = open("C:/Users/USER/Desktop/sowpods.txt", 'r')
line = file.readlines()
word_list = []
for word in line:
    word = word.strip()
    word_list.append(word)
file.close()

# choose word
choice_word = random.choice(word_list)
choice_word_list = list(choice_word)

# Make answer list
answer_list = []
for i in range(len(choice_word_list)):
    answer_list.append("_")
print(answer_list)

# Get the word from user
condition =  True

while condition:
    guess_word = input("Guess the letter: ").upper()

    while guess_word in answer_list:
        guess_word = input("Guess another letter: ").upper()

    for i in range(len(answer_list)):
        if choice_word_list[i] == guess_word:
            answer_list[i] = guess_word
            print(answer_list)

    if answer_list == choice_word_list:
        print("You guessed the correct word!")
        condition = False
```
