# 31. Guess Letters

In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter.   
The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed.   

Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”.   
For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.   
For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word.
