# 32. Hangman

In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.   
In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it.    
In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user.    
In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.   

# Answer

```python
import random

# introduction
print("Welcome to the Hangman Game!")

# import word file
file = open("C:/Users/USER/Desktop/sowpods.txt", 'r')
line = file.readlines()
word_list = []
for word in line:
    word = word.strip()
    word_list.append(word)
file.close()

# choose word
choice_word = random.choice(word_list)
choice_word_list = list(choice_word)

# Make answer list
answer_list = []
for i in range(len(choice_word_list)):
    answer_list.append("_")
print(answer_list)

# Get the word from user
condition = True
counter = 6

while condition:
    # Guess the word - count O
    guess_word = input("Guess the letter: ").upper()

    # If user input the letter already in the list 
    while guess_word in answer_list:
        guess_word = input("Guess another letter: ").upper()

    # If the user input the correct letter - count X
    for i in range(len(answer_list)):
        if choice_word_list[i] == guess_word:
            answer_list[i] = guess_word
            print(answer_list)
            counter += 1

    counter -= 1

    print(f"You have {counter} times of chance.")

    if answer_list == choice_word_list:
        print("You guessed the correct word!")
        print(counter)
        condition = False
    
    if counter == 0:
        print("Game over")
        condition = False
```
