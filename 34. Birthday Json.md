# 34. Birthday Json

In the previous exercise we created a dictionary of famous scientists’ birthdays.   
Modify your program to load the birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, rather than having the dictionary defined in the program.   

Bonus:   
Ask the user for another scientist’s name and birthday to add to the dictionary.   
And update the JSON file you have on disk with the scientist’s name.   
If you run the program multiple times and keep adding new names, your JSON file should keep getting bigger and bigger.

# Answer

```python
import json

celebrity = {
    "Albert Einstein" : "March 14, 1879",
    "Marie Curie" : "November 7, 1867",
    "Antoine Lavoisier" : "August 26, 1743",
    "Thomas Edison" : "February 11, 1847",
    "Galileo Galilei" : "February 15, 1564",
    "Nicolaus Copernicus" : "February 19, 1473",
    "James Watt" : "January 19, 1736",
    "Selena Gomez" : "July 22, 1992",
    "Alexander Graham Bell" : "August 2, 1922",
    "Isaac Newton" : "January 4, 1643",
    "Fritz Haber" : "December 9, 1868",
    "Jane Goodall" : "April 3, 1934",
    "Charles Darwin" : "February 12, 1809",
    "Leonhard Euler" : "April 15, 1707",
    "Stephen William Hawking" : "January 8, 1942",
}

# Read celebrities.json file
while True:
    celebrity_name = input("Put the name of one celebrity: ")
    if celebrity_name == "End":
        break
    celebrity_birthday_month = input("Input one celebrity's month of the birthday: ")
    celebrity_birthday_day = input("Input one celebrity's day of the birthday: ")
    celebrity_birthday_year = input("Input one celebrity's year of the birthday: ")
    
    
    celebrity[celebrity_name] = celebrity_birthday_month + " " + celebrity_birthday_day + ", " + celebrity_birthday_year
    

# Generate celebrities.json file
with open('c:/Users/USER/Desktop/celebrities.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(celebrity, f, indent = 4)
```
