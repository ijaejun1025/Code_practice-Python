# 35. Birthday Months

In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays.   
And count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.   

Your program should output something like:   

```python
{
	"May": 3,
	"November": 2,
	"December": 1
}
```

# Answer

```python
import json
import pprint

scientists = {
    "Albert Einstein" : "March 14, 1879",
    "Marie Curie" : "November 7, 1867",
    "Antoine Lavoisier" : "August 26, 1743",
    "Thomas Edison" : "February 11, 1847",
    "Galileo Galilei" : "February 15, 1564",
    "Nicolaus Copernicus" : "February 19, 1473",
    "James Watt" : "January 19, 1736",
    "Selena Gomez" : "July 22, 1992",
    "Alexander Graham Bell" : "August 2, 1922",
    "Isaac Newton" : "January 4, 1643",

    "Stephen Hawking" : "January 8, 1942",
    "James Dewey Watson" : "April 6, 1928",
}

    "August" : 0,
    "September" : 0,
    "October" : 0,
    "November" : 0,

# Count each month of scientists
for value in data.values():
    month = value.split()[0]
    
    if month in scientists_month:
        scientists_month[month] = scientists_month[month] + 1

pprint.pprint(scientists_month)
```
