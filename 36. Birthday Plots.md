# 36. Birthday Plots

In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.   
In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in.   

# Answer

```python
import json
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
from bokeh.io import output_notebook

output_notebook()

# Data of scientists.json file
scientists = {

# Count each month of scientists

# Draw the histogram
