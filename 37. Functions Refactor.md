# 37. Functions Refactor

One area of confusion for new coders is the concept of functions.    
So in this exercise, we will be stretching our functions muscle by refactoring an existing code snippet into using functions.

# Answer

```python
def snippest_refactor(width_number, height_number):
    for num in range(height_number):
        part_1 = " ---" * width_number
        print(part_1)
        part_2 = "|   " * width_number + "|"
        print(part_2)
    print(part_1)

number_1 = int(input("Input the width: "))
number_2 = int(input("Input the height: "))
snippest_refactor(number_1, number_2)
```
