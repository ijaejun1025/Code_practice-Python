# 38. f Strings

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.   
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.   
Do not use f-strings instead of the + operator to print the resulting output message.    

# Answer

```python
import datetime

name = input("What is your name? : ")
age = int(input("How old are you? : "))
turn_100_age = datetime.datetime.now().year - age + 100

print(name + " will be 100 years old in " + str(turn_100_age))
```
