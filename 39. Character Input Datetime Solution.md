# 39. Character Input Datetime Solution

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.    
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.    
Except donâ€™t explicitly write out the year.    
Use the built-in Python datetime library to make the code you write work during every year.   

# Answer

```python
import datetime

current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
name = input("What is your name? : ")
age = int(input("How old are you? : "))
print(f"f{name} will be 100 years old in {current_year - age + 100}")
```
