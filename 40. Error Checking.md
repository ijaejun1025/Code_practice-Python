# 40. Error Checking

Extended from Guessing Game One    
if the user does not enter a number between 1 and 9, tell them.    
Donâ€™t count this guess against the user when counting the number of guesses they used.    

# Answer

```python
import random

# computer number
com_number = random.randint(1, 9)

# user number
condition = True
count = 0

while condition:
    # Case 1 : Character (Error)
    try:
        user_number = int(input("Choose the number between 1 and 9 : "))
    except:
        print("The number is invalid.")
        continue
    
    # Case 2 : The number bigger than 9 or smaller than 1 (Error)
    if user_number > 9 or user_number < 1:
        print("The number is invalid.")
        continue
    
    # Case 3 : When the com_number is different with user_number
    elif user_number != com_number:
        print("Your number is wrong.")
        count += 1
    
    # Case 4 : When the com_number is same with user_number
    elif user_number == com_number:
        print(f'Computer chose {com_number}.')
        count += 1
        print(count)
        condition = False
```
