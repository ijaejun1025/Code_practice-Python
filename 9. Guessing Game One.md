# 9. Guessing Game One

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).   
Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.   

# Answer

```python
import random

computer_number = random.randrange(1,10)
print("Guess the special number between 1 and 9.")
user_number = input("Choose the number between 1 and 9:")
game_mode = True

while game_mode:
    if computer_number > int(user_number):
        print("Your number is smaller than special number.")
        user_number = input("Choose the number bigger than " + user_number + ".")
    elif computer_number < int(user_number):
        print("Your number is bigger than special number.")
        user_number = input("Choose the number smaller than " + user_number + ".")
    elif computer_number == int(user_number):
        print("Your number is correct!")
        game_mode = False
```
